In this project, we are going to investigate a particular problem of star formation, which is the gravitational collapse of dense cores (or prestellar cores) which occurs when they reach their Jeans mass. This process is at the origin of star formation and also, around the star and through angular momentum conservation, protostellar disk formation. \n"
